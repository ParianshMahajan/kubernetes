# In deploy replica sets, multiple replica of pods runs in the cluster and can multiple pods can run on the same node 

# DaemonSet -> Unlike deploy replica sets, daemon sets are used to run a copy of the pod on all the nodes running in the cluster
#           -> Each pod runs on a separate node. No. of replicas = No. of nodes
#           -> In case of new node added to the cluster, It detects the new node and create a new pod on the new node
#           -> Monitoring Agent, Logging Agent, kubeproxy, Weave-net, flanet, calico etc are the examples of daemon sets

# Monitoring/Logging Agent -> has to run all the time in each node to gather info from each node. Thats why daemon set is used
# kubeproxy -> used to manage the network rules and port netwoking between nodes in the cluster... Necessary to run on each node

# No need to mention replicas as it runs on all the nodes
# On control plane node, it contains taint :- due to which daemon set pods are not scheduled on control plane node
#                         because only control plane components can be scheduled on control plane node
